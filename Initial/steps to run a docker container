How to use it

Start the stack:
          docker compose up -d

MinIO:
          Console UI: http://localhost:9001
          S3 API: http://localhost:9000

Default credentials in the compose: MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin, MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin123

Jupyter Notebook:
          URL: http://localhost:8888
          Token: mytoken (change this or use an .env file / Docker secrets for production)
Workspace on host: ./work (mounted into the container)

Quick notes & suggestions

Change the default credentials before using on any public/production machine. Prefer an .env file or Docker secrets for sensitive values.

The YAML includes a healthcheck for MinIO and depends_on so Jupyter waits for MinIO container start (but it does not wait until MinIO is fully ready — the healthcheck helps).

The Jupyter service injects MinIO credentials as environment variables so your notebooks can use boto3, s3fs, or Spark's s3a connector.
